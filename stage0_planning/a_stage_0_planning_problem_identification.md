# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state your problem

# Context
<!-- [What is the context for your work. What area of application. It can be travelling, pet treatment, shopping. State the overall context and why it is interesting to think about it.] -->

Our project focuses on bringing people together from anywhere in the world, either by simply hanging out or practicing a sport with others, being able to integrate people that live nearby and may find difficult getting in touch with new people. 

The main area of focus of this project is outdoors activities (i.e. practicing a sport, forming a group of people, and many others).

# Challenges
<!-- [What are aspects that remain a challenge? What is difficult to do? What could profit from a more customizable approach?] -->

One of the biggest challenges that still remain in this area is **how** we can integrate people on a broader scenario, since not everyone is the same. Some people are more comfortable with strangers than others, and vice versa. One scenario could be integrating one stranger in a group where everyone else already knows each other, except one person.

One way to help tackle this issue is try to group people with similar interests, since finding something mutual between people is a major step in integration.

# The goal
<!-- [In a short sentence state what is the problem you wish to address] -->
The end goal of this project is to have a platform where people can publish not only their interests in order for people to connect with each other, but for people to express availability on practicing activities with others, or a group's interest in taking other people in.
