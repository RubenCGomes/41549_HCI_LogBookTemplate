## Task Overview

### What sports do you usually practice?
Usually cycling on his free time, not much else from that.

### Do you find it hard to find people to cycle with, and if so, what obstacles do you face?
He does find it hard. He likes to cycle on his own normally, but he wouldn't mind having people to go alongside him. Prefers a mix of both cycling alone and together.

Some of the obstacles that he faces are:
 - Lack of interest on the sport by most of his friends
 - Has a hard time getting a date down where everyone can agree on it

## Tools & Environment 

### How do you plan the hobbies with your friends?
Either by texting each other in a online group or each person individually, or in person.

### Are there any frustrations or limitations with these tools?
Not really. The most troublesome method would be directly in person, but is easily avoided by texting the person. He does not have the requirement of a new platform to plan his hobbies with his friends, only to use it to find people that can join him.

### What features/filters would you like to see implemented? 
Some features that were mentioned were:
 - Filter by location and interests (held accountable at the start).
 - A way to filter by a person's performance (low, medium and high), since cycling is a sport of "keeping up" with each other.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

### What would an ideal solution look like for them? 
An ideal solution would be one where he could express his interest in going cycling, have others join him according to his criteria, and everyone would have a fun time, resulting in new friendships.

### What concerns arise when trying to connect to new people?
Some of the concerns presented were:
- Not being able to get along very well with the other people
- Fear of being left aside (when joining a pre-existing group)

### When would you say that the application has fulfilled your goals?
According to him, when he would be able to plan a task, get along with people and make new friends.

## Additional Observations 
It was also asked to the interviewee if he would like to see our application partnering up with AAUAv. This would help to effortlessly integrate our goals with theirs and potentially make it more appealing to others.
He disagreed, as they could impose some features that could fall back to a scheduling problem, and not being as flexible with scheduling.
