## Expectations for a Novel Approach (not applicable, as the user doesn't have a direct interest in the main focus)

## Important Notes  
In the realm of video games, the participant gave valuable insights on the fact that the people he searches for to fill groups depend on the level of seriousness of the game. As an example, for a casual game, he cares more about their personality; however, for more competitive matches, he prefers someone with a higher skill level despite their personality. This information could be used in our app to filter activities based on their type (casual/competitive), as well as a way to filter players based on their skill level.
