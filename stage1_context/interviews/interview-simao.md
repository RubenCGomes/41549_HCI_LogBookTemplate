## Task Overview 

### What sports do you usually practice?
On the weekends he likes to play football with his friends, back at his hometown.

### Do you find it hard to find people to <PRACTICE-SPORT> with, and if so, what obstacles do you face?
Simão expressed a strong interest in integrating new people into his football group.

Since he already has a group of friends, he rarely has issues finding people to play with. However, he does find it hard to get someone to replace a friend when that friend cannot attend the activity.

Some of these issues are:
 - Living in a remote environment, where finding more people is hard
 - Some people aren't as comfortable as others around people they don't know
