## Background  
<!-- [Describe the persona's background, including their education, work experience, and any relevant personal history. This should be written as a short, engaging narrative that helps to contextualize the persona.] -->

João is from a small town in the center of Portugal, where he is used to more of a traditional village lifestyle, where people mostly know each other and all sorts of activities are easy to come by.

Now he is in his first year living outside of his home to pursue a degree in mathematics in Lisboa after graduating from high school in his hometown.

Besides his keen interest in mathematics and other academic interests, he enjoys practicing sports such as volleyball and biking.

## Daily Life  
<!-- [Describe a typical day in their life. What do they do from morning to evening? How do they interact with technology, products, or services? What challenges do they face?] -->

João's daily life consists of a rather common student routine, wake up early to prepare for his classes that mostly take the mornings and occasionally early afternoons. 

In between classes he enjoys going to lunch or just hanging out with his friends. Most of the rest of his afternoons are spent either revising study materials from classes or doing daily chores.

However, his evenings are rather scarce and empty, as he ends up spending them doing activities such as scrolling social media or playing games.

## Goals & Needs  
<!-- [Explain what the persona wants to achieve in their personal or professional life. What are their aspirations? What problems are they trying to solve?]   -->

João aspires to specialize in the mathematics area and apply his knowledge to areas such as informatics, for that end he studies regularly and always attends class. 

He also intends to keep a healthy and active lifestyle, as he was always used to back at his home, being more extroverted in that regard.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
<!-- [Describe the main frustrations, obstacles, or inefficiencies they encounter related to the product or service you are designing for.] -->

Despite experiencing a good integration environment with his new peers, most of them don't share his interest in volleyball and biking.

João, who is used to a village-like environment where finding people to do any sort of activity was easy and happened in a somewhat natural way is now faced with a completely different reality in a big city, where finding people to practice these activities is way harder.

He tried the college clubs, however their fixed schedules were not compatible with his irregular study schedules that were heavily dependent on how much work he needs done.

João is now in a situation where he feels unhappy and insatisfied that he might have to put aside his hobbies due to lack of solutions to his problem.

## Motivation  
<!-- *"Why do they engage with this product or service?"*   -->

<!-- [Summarize their core motivation in a compelling way. This could be a short paragraph or even a strong, direct quote that captures their drive.]   -->

By using a app that allows him to find activities with various schedules that better adapt to his necessities, João can keep his academic ambitions without having to give up on his hobbies thus solving his problem.
