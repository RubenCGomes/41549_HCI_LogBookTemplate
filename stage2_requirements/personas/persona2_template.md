## Background

Diogo is a Second year student on a Biology master's program. He is currently writing his thesis on funghi and their possible applications in ecosystem recovery.

He has been studying in his home city Lisboa for 5 years now and despite his usually busy schedule, he loves playing sports, specially volleyball. 
Used to the busy lifestyle of a big city during his early years in college, he started a group with friends to practice sports.

Besides his studies, Diogo is currently working part-time in a company working in the biotechnology area to support the costs of living and studying on a city as expensive as Lisboa. However, this reduces the ammount of free time he has drastically.
## Daily Life  
<!-- [Describe a typical day in their life. What do they do from morning to evening? How do they interact with technology, products, or services? What challenges do they face?] -->

Diogo's has a very hectic daily life. He starts the day really early in order to work as much as possible on researching and writing his thesis. Sometimes he also needs to attend meetings with tutors and other researchers.

Depending on the day of the week and necessity he might also have to spend some time with part-time job related work. Usually the ammount of work ends up making him spend his entire day in front of his laptop.

Creating a need to relax and exercise in order to "escape" this constrained environment, he usually tries to plan activities with his group. However, busy schedules usually make it so there is not enough people for certain activities, eventually causing them to be cancelled, which makes Diogo end up straying away from a active life style and spending his free time on videogames or social media.

<!-- [Explain what the persona wants to achieve in their personal or professional life. What are their aspirations? What problems are they trying to solve?] -->

In his personal life he is looking for ways to be more active and to be able to practice sports as often as possible, attempting to stray away from a sedentary lifestyle.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
<!-- [Describe the main frustrations, obstacles, or inefficiencies they encounter related to the product or service you are designing for.] -->

While seeking a solution for the recurrent lack of people problem his group is faced with, Diogo searched for alternatives but the only option found were the college sport clubs whose schedules were not compatible with most people in the friend group, causing Diogo and his group to not be able to practice big team sports such as volleyball and football.

## Motivation  
<!-- *"Why do they engage with this product or service?"*   -->
<!-- [Summarize their core motivation in a compelling way. This could be a short paragraph or even a strong, direct quote that captures their drive.]   -->

By using a app that allows him to create activities visible to other users who might want to participate Diogo can solve the lack of people problem enabling him and his group to find people to complete teams for sports and activities like volleyball, thus solving Diogo's and his group's problem.
