# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Diogo looks for people to play volleyball

Upon completion of his academic duties, JoÃ£o wants some time to relax and practice his favorite sport, volleyball. However, as his friends donâ€™t share his liking for the sport and the college volleyball club is not on his available time, JoÃ£o uses an app where he can see nearby events and filters those related to volleyball. He finds groups of people who need more players to fill teams, so he joins the activity, goes to the place at the announced time, and plays his favorite sport, extending his social circle to people who share tastes with him.

Instead of staying idly at home, JoÃ£o exercises and meets new people who he can contact when he wants to play volleyball again.




## Scenario 2: Diogo looks for people to play volleyball

After a long day of working on his thesis and his part-time job, Diogo feels like playing volleyball, so he texts his friend group. However, on such short notice, most of them arenâ€™t available, and even with the ones who can, they are still missing some people to have full teams. Diogo then uses an app that allows him to create a volleyball match event. This event is visible to a variety of other users, and the ones interested can quickly join in. Within minutes, the activity that was bound not to happen due to a lack of players is full.

Diogo is able to play one of his favorite sports while meeting his friends and new people who might want to participate in future games. Thus solving his problem on a short term scale but also making the process easier on a wider time frame.
